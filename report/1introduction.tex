\chapter{Introduction}


Many places in the world encounter internet censorship.
To try to get around the censorship, numerous different techniques, some very creative, were developed.
Depending on the threat model, the goal can be to either "just" circumvent the censorship or to also hide the fact that circumvention took place from the censors.
\textit{Steganography} \cite{wiki:Steganography} \textit{techniques} \cite{wiki:List_of_steganography_techniques} can help with the latter goal.
Internet censorship doesn't happen equally everywhere.
It is often employed to restrict access of a population to sensitive information and, as such, is much more likely to be present on types of internet connections used by many people, as opposed to e.g. data centers.
These types of internet connections are optimized for low cost and include access technologies such as cellular networks, DSL, and WLAN.
People are likely using portable or low-power devices such as laptops and phones, as opposed to servers.

Censored internet connections are also commonly found in public spaces like coffee shops, hotels, and city-wide WiFi networks, where users rely on shared, often unencrypted, and bandwidth-limited connections.


The \textit{Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI)} \cite{OONI} project measures internet censorship.
Censorship in the real world can be done in many different ways:
\begin{itemize}
  \item TODO: Zensur sieht in der Realit√§t anders aus
  \item Passively analyzing the data traffic and sending TCP RST packets to terminate unwanted TCP connections
  \item Filtering DNS queries and return useless responses for unwanted domains
  \item Drop all packets to certain IP addresses
  \item \todo{add more items and add structure with sub-items}
\end{itemize}
These types of censorship can be circumvented in a variety of ways, e.g. fake TCP RST packets sent by unsophisticated firewalls can often be differentiated from the real ones and then simply ignored\todo{reference project to circumvent the Russian firewall}.
More sophisticated firewalls can be circumvented by tunneling.

Running these protocols on phones or other mobile devices also constrains the available CPU and RAM resources.
However, these censorship circumvention protocols are likely developed in laboratory conditions with ideal networks and plentiful computational resources.
These are not the same conditions encountered in the real world, where networks may have a high latency, high packet loss and low throughput.

For this reason, we aim to analyze the behaviour of different censorship circumvention protocols under these conditions.
Specifically, we ask the research question:
\emph{``How do censorship circumvention protocols react to bad network conditions?''}
This research question breaks up into the following sub-questions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item How much packet size overhead does each protocol add?
  \item How much does the MTU decrease by using each protocol?
  \item How much additional latency does each protocol add?
  \item Do any protocols introduce additional packet loss?
  \item How much processing power and RAM does each protocol consume/require?
\end{enumerate}

We answer these research questions using a simulation environment.
Accurately simulating real-world conditions is challenging.
We use \textit{tc-netem} \cite{man8:tc-netem}, Linux's network emulator, as an approximation of the real world.
We first use the NixOS testing framework to simulate our test setup using VMs for experimentation and then run the setup on real hardware to make sure that our results are not influenced by the virtualisation.

As censorship circumvention protocols usually work like a network tunnel, transporting the actual payload inside of them, we are also looking for pathological behaviour of the protocols such as unreasonable packet loss or latencies inside the tunnel compared to outside under unfavorable network conditions.

\section{Structure}
The remainder of this thesis is structured as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item In \Cref{chap:background}, we summarize previous research on the topic and introduce background information and terms.
  \item Subsequently, in \Cref{chap:methodology}, we describe our test setup and how we measure things.
  \item Next, in \Cref{chap:results}, we show the results of our measurements and compare them to each other.
  \item In \Cref{chap:discussion}, we answer our research questions and discuss interesting and surprising findings.
  We also reflect on the limitations of our testing methodology, and on areas where we could have done better.
  \item Finally, in \Cref{chap:conclusion}, we briefly summarize our research and discuss future work.
\end{itemize}
