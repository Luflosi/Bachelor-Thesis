\section{Limitations}
\todo{was haben wir nicht gut gemacht?}

measure in both directions to check if protocols behave symmetrically

test iodine

test obfs4

use IPv6

use something other than iperf3, which does not require an initial handshake

also try using a connection oriented protocol like TCP instead of UDP to see the influence of the congestion control protocol.

test the tor transport? \todo{read some more about this transport protocol}

Try out \href{https://github.com/rbruenig/qperf}{qperf}?

netboot hardware

make queues in router bigger to allow for longer delays

unit tests for analysis scripts

vary maximum bandwidth

Change IPv4 payload size depending on protocol to accurately simulate a lower MTU

don't test all combinations of all protocols.
Instead, keep everything constant and only change one variable.
That way, can actually create some graphs and have to test way less.

\todo[inline]{describe measurement failure scenario like in email}

Connect router(s) to switch using two physical interfaces instead of one physical one with multiple VLANS to avoid running into bottlenecks when data is transferred in both directions with a total bandwidth higher than simplex can support
