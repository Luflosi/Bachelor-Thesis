Effective censorship evasion is crucial for maintaining access to information in restricted environments.
This thesis examines the overhead of various protocols designed to bypass censorship.
We present the results of experiments conducted under realistic network conditions.
This chapter synthesizes our findings, and identifies areas for future research to enhance these techniques.
