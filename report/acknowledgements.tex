I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my advisor \todo{is this the correct word?} Tobias Fiebig \todo{add Dr.-Ing?} for his consistent guidance, invaluable feedback, and unwavering support during the whole of this project. The depth of his expertise in the field and his mentorship were essential in shaping the direction and successful completion of this work.

\todo{thank supervisors?}

\todo{thank examination office?}

I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to my friends for their support.

I would also like to thank Jacek Galowicz for helping me make the VM tests scale to thousands of tests without running out of memory and with great performance.
