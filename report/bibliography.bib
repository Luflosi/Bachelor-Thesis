	            algorithm was introduced by Google in 2016. Unlike prior
	            congestion-control algorithms (CCAs), BBR does not rely on
	            signals that are weakly correlated with congestion (e.g., packet
	            loss and transient queue delay). Instead, it characterizes a path
	            using two parameters, bottleneck bandwidth and round-trip
	            propagation time, and is designed to converge with a high
	            probability to Kleinrock's optimal operating point [34].
	            Essentially, in stable state, BBR maximizes throughput while
	            minimizing delay and loss. Google has used BBR for a significant
	            fraction of its network traffic both within its datacenters and
	            on its WAN since 2017 [15]. BBR's interaction dynamics with Cubic
	            , the widely used CCA in the Internet, has received intense
	            scrutiny: Some studies observed BBR to be unfair to Cubic, or
	            generally loss-based CCAs. Google, to its credit, has diligently
	            revised BBR's design to address the criticisms. This paper
	            focuses on characterizing the promises and potential of the third
	            , and most recent, revision of BBR---introduced to the public in
	            July 2023. We empirically evaluate BBRv3's performance across a
	            range of network scenarios, e.g., considering different buffer
	            sizes, round-trip times, packet losses, and flow-size
	            distributions. We show that despite the improvements and
	            optimizations introduced in BBRv3, it struggles to achieve an
	            equitable sharing of bandwidth when competing with Cubic, the
	            widely used CCA in the Internet, in a wide range of network
	            conditions.",
