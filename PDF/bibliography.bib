	            algorithm was introduced by Google in 2016. Unlike prior
	            congestion-control algorithms (CCAs), BBR does not rely on
	            signals that are weakly correlated with congestion (e.g., packet
	            loss and transient queue delay). Instead, it characterizes a path
	            using two parameters, bottleneck bandwidth and round-trip
	            propagation time, and is designed to converge with a high
	            probability to Kleinrock's optimal operating point [34].
	            Essentially, in stable state, BBR maximizes throughput while
	            minimizing delay and loss. Google has used BBR for a significant
	            fraction of its network traffic both within its datacenters and
	            on its WAN since 2017 [15]. BBR's interaction dynamics with Cubic
	            , the widely used CCA in the Internet, has received intense
	            scrutiny: Some studies observed BBR to be unfair to Cubic, or
	            generally loss-based CCAs. Google, to its credit, has diligently
	            revised BBR's design to address the criticisms. This paper
	            focuses on characterizing the promises and potential of the third
	            , and most recent, revision of BBR---introduced to the public in
	            July 2023. We empirically evaluate BBRv3's performance across a
	            range of network scenarios, e.g., considering different buffer
	            sizes, round-trip times, packet losses, and flow-size
	            distributions. We show that despite the improvements and
	            optimizations introduced in BBRv3, it struggles to achieve an
	            equitable sharing of bandwidth when competing with Cubic, the
	            widely used CCA in the Internet, in a wide range of network
	            conditions.",

We go on to classify replications into six types along two dimensions. Finally, we present a detailed argument for the significance of replication in social science research and propose a multifocal pattern of knowledge accumulation to be integrated with the scattered pattern commonly found in organizational science.},

	            filesystem in some popular versions of Linux. It is based on
	            copy-on-write, allowing for efficient snapshots and clones. It
	            uses B-trees as its main on-disk data structure. The design goal
	            is to work well for many use cases and workloads. To this end,
	            much effort has been directed to maintaining even performance as
	            the filesystem ages, rather than trying to support a particular
	            narrow benchmark use-case.Linux filesystems are installed on
	            smartphones as well as enterprise servers. This entails
	            challenges on many different fronts.---Scalability. The
	            filesystem must scale in many dimensions: disk space, memory, and
	            CPUs.---Data integrity. Losing data is not an option, and much
	            effort is expended to safeguard the content. This includes
	            checksums, metadata duplication, and RAID support built into the
	            filesystem.---Disk diversity. The system should work well with
	            SSDs and hard disks. It is also expected to be able to use an
	            array of different sized disks, which poses challenges to the
	            RAID and striping mechanisms.This article describes the core
	            ideas, data structures, and algorithms of this filesystem. It
	            sheds light on the challenges posed by defragmentation in the
	            presence of snapshots, and the tradeoffs required to maintain
	            even performance in the face of a wide spectrum of workloads.},
